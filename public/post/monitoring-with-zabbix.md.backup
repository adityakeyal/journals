# Overview of Monitoring

## What is monitoring?
To understand monitoring, let us first try an understand how is monitoring defined.
**Definition:**

> **Observe** and check the *progress* or **quality** of (something) over a period of time; keep under **systematic review**.

Lets understand the critical words from the above definition.
 - Observe
 - Quality
 - Systemic review

The idea behind any monitoring solution is to be able to continuously observe quality parameters. 
Here the quality should be quantitative ,  i.e. it should be measurable in units. 
A simple example is when you have a fever, the doctors ask you to measure the temperature at a regular interval. They rely on absolute measurement over a period of time. If you had a sudden fever spike once and only once, often its considered an abberation and can be given lower priority.



## Why should we monitor?
### Know when something is wrong
As a site owner/ system administrator or even  a user, I want to know if a particular site is not working properly. This allows people to take informed decisions and avoid bigger issues.
One should be on the lookout for symtoms rather than wait for a full blown disaster.

### Understand business impact

Another critical reason to monitor is often driven by the need to understand the business impact. 
If you are running an application, implies there is some impact. The impact could be to paying customers it could be to your shareholders or it could be to simply your or your company's reputation.

The impact may sometimes be small like :

or it can be huge

> A 63-minute Amazon outage on its “Prime” sales day in 2018 cost the company nearly $100 million (£76 million) according to an estimate```

> In March 2015, a 12-hour Apple store outage cost the company $25 million. 

> In August 2016, a five-hour power outage in an operation center caused 2,000 cancelled flights and an estimated loss of $150 million for Delta Airlines.

> In March 2019, a 14-hour outage cost facebook an estimated $90 million. 

> In 2013 , Google temporarily went dark for 5 minutes, causing a 40% drop in web traffic

The value of brand image can never be understated.


### Find the root cause. Fast

Whenever an issue happens, the first intinct is to do everything to resolve the problem quickly. However something that is of equally importance (if not more)is being able to find the root cause of the issue.
To find any root cause, we need a lot of runtime information, and that is where the continuous monitoring comes into play.

Having enough data helps us find proper root cause. 

### Don't ignore the symtoms

Let us describe these components in more details.
